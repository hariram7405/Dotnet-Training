## üß± Class Overview

| Class / Interface | Type           | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Book`            | Abstract Class | Base class containing shared book attributes and a virtual `Display()` method |
| `Fiction`         | Class          | Inherits from `Book`; includes additional `Genre` and implements `IRentable`  |
| `NonFiction`      | Class          | Inherits from `Book`; includes `Category` and implements `IRentable`          |
| `IRentable`       | Interface      | Declares `Rent()`, `Return()`, and `ReportStatus()` methods                   |
| `IServicable`     | Interface      | Declares library service actions like `RentBook()`, `ReturnBook()`, etc.      |
| `BookServices`    | Service Class  | Implements `IServicable`, manages the collection of books                     |

## üß† Object-Oriented Concepts Used

| Concept           | How It's Applied                                                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Abstraction**   | Interfaces (`IRentable`, `IServicable`) hide implementation details        |
| **Inheritance**   | `Fiction` and `NonFiction` extend from `Book` class                        |
| **Polymorphism**  | Overridden `Display()` methods, interface-based dynamic method dispatch    |
| **Encapsulation** | Book attributes are defined in classes and accessed through public members |
